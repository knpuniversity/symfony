title: Symfony Forms: Build, Render & Conquer!

summary: |
    Ah, forms: one of the most *powerful* - but sometimes
    hated - features in all of Symfony. Here's the deal: forms
    are just plain hard. You need to manage the HTML form elements,
    validation, data transformation and a lot more. The Form
    component is probably the most complex part of Symfony. But
    the more you work with it, the more you'll like it.

    In this episode, we'll learn how to use Symfony forms to
    handle simple situations as well as some complex setups.
    Most importantly, I'll show you how to avoid the pitalls
    that many developers often fall into that causes the form
    component to spiral into complexity hell. The form system
    is a tool: in this tutorial, we'll put the joy back into it:

    * Creating a basic form
    * Basic form rendering and customization
    * Handling a form submit
    * Backing your form with an entity
    * Adding validation
    * Form field guessing
    * Pre-filling with default data
    * Creating a form "type" class
    * Using forms to handle an API POST request
    * Understanding how forms *really* work
    * Flash messages

    ... and form tips and tricks stuck in all over!
