title: Mastering Doctrine Relationships in Symfony

summary: |
    In the [part 1 of the Doctrine Tutorial](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/symfony-doctrine)
    we got a *sweet* setup with Doctrine: entities, queries, migrations and fixtures.
    
    But, we left out *one* big piece: database relations. Once you've mastered these,
    you'll be unstoppable. Unfortunately, a lot of information out there make Doctrine
    relations look over-complicated. Actually, they're simple and beautiful. Sure,
    they have some pitfalls - but they'll also help you build a complex data structure
    in no time.

    * ManyToOne relationships (associations)
    * The OneToMany side of a relation
    * The downfall of owning versus inverse sides of a relation
    * Doing magic with the ArrayCollection
    * Querying with Joins

    ... and more - like some magic with the "Param Conversion".
